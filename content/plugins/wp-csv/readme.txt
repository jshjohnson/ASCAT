* Posts, pages, and custom post types
* Tags, categories, and custom taxonomies  
* Custom fields (simple and complex)
* Thumbnails
* Flexible filter system to easily control which fields export
* Simple User Interface (if you know Excel or another spreadsheet program, you will find this plugin quite easy)
The plugin should now be usable with most plugins that are fully Wordpress compliant.
