			<p>HTA Project:12/35/27 - Total Ankle Replacement Versus Ankle Arthrodesis (TARVA) trial: A pragmatic, randomised controlled trial to assess clinical and cost effectiveness, with an internal feasibility phase.</p>

			<p>Ankle osteoarthritis (OA) occurs when the cartilage lining the joints has become worn, causing pain and stiffness and major disability with a similar impact on quality of life as hip OA and congestive heart failure. The majority of ankle OA follows trauma or injury, although inflammation (such as rheumatoid arthritis) can also be a cause. Over 29,000 cases of symptomatic ankle OA are referred to specialist foot and ankle surgeons each year in the UK. The ankle is injured more than any other joint, indeed ankle sprains are one of the commonest reasons for attending Emergency Departments. The incidence of ankle fractures is increasing especially in young athletes and elderly females. After an unstable ankle fracture, radiographic ankle OA can occur in up to 66% of patients within 6 years. Many patients are afflicted in their sixth decade, during their working life.</p>
			 
			<h2>Sub-heading</h2>

			<p>In the early stages of disease non-operative measures such as change in activity levels, weight loss, physiotherapy, pain killers and ankle braces should be used. We have defined “end stage OA as a combination of unrelenting symptoms sufficient to make the patient consider surgical intervention; radiological changes consistent with OA; and failure of at least 6 months of non-operative measures. Surgery is only considered when all non-operative measures have failed.</p>

			<p>The main surgical treatments for end-stage ankle OA are ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement (TAR). Ankle arthrodesis is the commonest surgical treatment but patients are increasingly requesting TAR and so the number of surgeons performing this procedure is also increasing. Approximately 3,000 patients undergo ankle arthrodesis or TAR in the NHS each year, with much variation in practice across the country. Both treatments are available on the NHS, and both have been reported to have good results. Some studies suggest that TAR restores a more natural walking pattern than ankle fusion but other studies have suggested that the need for further surgery is higher with TAR than with fusion. Information on all TARs implanted in the NHS has been captured on the National Joint Registry since 2010, but no similar national registry exists for ankle fusion. There has never been a randomized trial directly comparing the two procedures and therefore it is difficult to recommend the best procedure for a patient.</p>
